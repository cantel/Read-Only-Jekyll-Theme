With Christmas day being the only day forecasted to be clear-skied in the mountains
over the next few days, the ma and pa Antrim just having moved to the Pacific Northwest smack dab in the
middle of the Cascade Mountains, and their children home for the holidays where else
would we all be itching to go?

We head out early to make it to the slopes at the Mt. Baker ski resort, situated
between Mt. Baker and Mt. Shuksan (fun fact: nearby mountains are named Mt. Despair,
Mt. Terror, and, closing on a lighter note, Mt. Triumph). The rest of the family packed
snacks -- trail mix, granola bars, etc... -- but I made sure to stash the bread and
other sandwich ammunition in my pack for later. The group consisted of ma and pops
Antrim, myself, my sister, and Matt. Not only did we pack in my sister and Matt's
snowboards into the car, wich they lugged up to Washington from Southern California,
but also the rock now residing on my sister's left hand -- Matt having popped the question
the previous day, which my sister answered affirmatively.

I had never been to Washington before this trip and before this I was under the
assumption that the Bald Eagle -- the American icon -- was somehow near extinction. Not so. These things
are <em>everywhere</em>: in my parents' backyard watching my poor little pup with hungry eyes,
in the forest spying us on our hikes from atop the trees, diving and catching fish from the wetlands
just off the coast. <em>Everywhere</em>. And they are yuuge. On our drive up to Mt. Baker,
on a wind-break line of 5 or 6 trees alongside a farm we saw what probably amounted to 100 Bald
Eagles perched in the morning cold waiting for the morning stretch of field mice.

My parents dropped us off at the main lodge and took off to the other
side of the mountain to put their newly acquired snow shoes to work. I got my snowboard rented
and we were off. Very nice print, with a snow-covered fir on it matching the surrounding
landscapes of the Pacific Northwest which is covered in firs and cedars.

After a few hours of shredding the gnar and with the sun beginning to go behind the
mountains it was clearly time for a sandwich break. Stopping at the top of the
chairlift we walked over to the bottom of a steep hill which continued further up and set up shop. Now, it was
cold this day, especially on this side of the mountain. The thermometer reading
 between 15 and 17 degrees Fahrenheit (roughly -9 degrees Celsius) and the sun was yet to be
fully behind the mountain. The water in my
Camel bak froze and became dead weight after about an hour in and, since they didn't rent goggles at the lodge
and I wasn't about to buy a new pair, each time we went up the lifts
I thought my contact lenses were about to freeze to my eyes. So taking
off the gloves to make sandwiches was flirting with frost bite. Worth it.

The base of the hill that we were sitting at was beyond the "ski-area fence" by a few meters
and was the starting point for people skiing off-piste on the other side of the valley (at the top
of the hill they made a U-turn to the left following the end of the valley and were skiing directly
opposite us about 400 meters off). I say this since, just as I had got all the items settled a couple of
bozos near us began talking to ski patrol about skiing over there. The ski patrol was
saying that unless they had the proper training, transponders, shovels, and knowledge
of the area they would not be able to join the others. At the point
where the ski patrol pointed out the left and then the right edge of the valley, the
latter being where we were sitting, he saw us outside of the ski area and promptly told us to 
move. Hands wooden with cold I threw everything back in my pack and shimmied under the fence,
leaving the board dug into the snow where it was and quickly tore everything out again
to re-make the spread after sticking my hands underneath my jacket and shirt to 
get some feeling back in them. Other skiers and snowboarders coming off the lift having
no idea what this idiot with a loaf of bread and bare hands fidgetting with a knife and glass
jar on the top of a mountain was doing. Used to it.

For the sandwich I went with an asiago-toasted loaf that I picked up at a nice wine, bread, and coffee shop near
my parents' place.
For its innards, I swathed on a healthy covering of mushroom and garlic tapenade, picked up at the
same local "general store" as the bread, with some slices of backpack-bruised honeycrisp apple (the best kind),
nice slices of Comte cheese (rind-inclusive) which I smuggled over from France just for such
an occasion as well as to introduce to my sister, and, to help the apple in complementing the Comte and
tapenade, a few bricks of 99% Lindt, which I was also trying to get my sister to enjoy. There
was also some snow in there as I lost some hand-sandwich coordination for a bit there.

Couldn't feel my hands or face, but could definitely taste the delicous sandwich. Fuel
for sailing down the fresh powder. All in all a good day boardin' with the sister and future-sister-husband Matt
and on new mountains to boot!
