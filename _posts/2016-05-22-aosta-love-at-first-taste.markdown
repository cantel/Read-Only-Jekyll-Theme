Carrefour-fresh salmon and rings of olives on a fluffy breadloaf slightly soaked in honey.
A bite into it and knew I was at (my future retirement) home.

The first time I discovered Aosta Valley, the magical place through the Mont Blanc tunnel,
was when my parents came to visit me at CERN. We spent a weekend in May, hiking several routes,
sometimes knee-deep in snow.

The sandwich was inherently tasty but made even more so by the treacherous journey we were busy
undertaking. We had just made it to the top of a rocky ledge next to a waterfall, after
having edged across three snow-filled ravines.
This lunch break was merely a breather from trying to survive for the last couple of hours, and bracing ourselves to
continue the perilous way
over and across the waterfall and
down the steep loose-stoned mountain side.

Still, #loveVDA !
