It was Busty's Birthday and he got some birthday climbs *and* a bite of a sandwich.

Putting Germany on the map!

Turns out my backyard in Heidelberg has some pretty sweet single pitch climbing, perfect for late autumn
weather as the quarry - or Steinbruch in German - was enveloped in a baking warm blanket whilst below
us the Autumn chill crept through the town streets.

After a night of dancing and drinking into his birthday (welcome back, ha, Busty*! ;) ) Busty and Clara met me
in town and together we cycled/skated to the foot of Schriesheim's vineyard covered hills.
A hike passed the Strahlenburg (castle), whilst Clara sings "Under Pressure", and an unclipped via ferrata later we're at the Steinbruch
and too many climbs to choose from.

All of us got our lead climbing on! ("Under pressure, pressure...")

And Busty still tackled the rocks at dusk...

Too busy climbing, the sandwich featured on this adventure - our first deutsche sandwich! - is a dusk sandwich,
and autumn coloured: red dried cherries, bright yellow cheese and golden agave syrup.
Sam was not around to bestow upon this glittering sandwich his disapproval seal, but
we do have Busty's verdict which was "hmmmm!".

A hell of a feel-good day all in all!
Happy Birthday Busty, and thanks so much for the warm memories. : )

\* It's actually Basti, but the alternative "American" spelling caught on quickly  :P
