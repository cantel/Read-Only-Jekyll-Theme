After a long week's work there is nothing nicer than receiving a broadcast e-mail from Sam-wise
declaring that a hut hike should be had.

Despite many on the e-mail thread dropping out at the thought of it,
Sam insisted that we stay overnight in the hut rather than return on the same day we
start. This meant that the weak-willed were whittled away and we were left with a
whiley crew: myself (Danny), Sam-wise, Babette, Josh, and Jordan.  

We head out Saturday morning for the end of the Chamonix valley where the 1000+ meter
uphill trek would start in the village of <b>La Tour</b>. Thankfully Babette suggested
she drive given that her car was bigger (and also I have not got around to re-insuring
my car for the past month).

We were sure to make a stop
at the greatest Carrefour of all, the one that sits just off the side of the road
as you enter the town of Chamonix and just beside what else other than a ski jump
left over from winter olympics past. We picked up plenty of items for lunch and dinner,
a couple of bottles of wine, and a small flask-sized bottle of whiskey. We were sure
that we bought much more than what was possible to eat and given past experience this was
surely the case.

Not so long after, we began our hike to the refuge, <b>Refuge Albert 1er</b>, from the
small village of La Tour with cows jingling their bells beneath the still ski-lifts
and chewing the grass that would soon be covered with snow and skiers and a dragging
lift that <it>Claire just will not go on</it>. We were taking the scenic route
that followed, for the first bit, ski slopes (now turned mountain bike trails)
and after about an hour or so we reached the top of the chair lift return and
were to have a quick lunch.

The lunch spot views (seen at the top of this post) are incredible, being at the
end of Chamonix valley they offer some of the best views for looking down its
length with Mont Blanc in plain view. What's more is that we were lunching
with the exact same lunch spot views that Claire and I had along with fellow Heidelberg
colleagues (Busty) 7 months prior in the height of snowboard season:

Needless to say the dual-views made this an even more pleasant hike to be had. 

For lunch: a sandwich of <b>bresaola</b> slices, one of my new favorite cheeses, brought
by Babette, <b>appenzeller</b>, <b>raisins/cranberries</b> from my trail-mix bag,
a few potato <b>chips</b> mainly for the crunch, all between <b>poppy-seed baguette</b>. Enjoyed
on the side with some 90% Lindt (Carrefour was out of the real stuff) and
a dash of the William peel whiskey for the warmth as the cold winds were picking up now
that we were higher up in this valley's end.

A few hours later and we made it to the winter room of the refuge. One of the nicest
winter rooms I've seen so far, complete with two floors with the second composed of
two rooms of beds, enough wood-stock for a year,
a furnace for melting snow into water and drying socks & boots, and a signatory book
to make sure the hut owners know who they have to go dig out of the ice the next
time they're there.

After going
out on the Glacier du Tour to collect more water we came back to the hut
where other climbers had begun to gather for the evening. Sam-wise, the fire-boss, started a fire in the
furnace and soon after as the hut began to warm and evening to set we started dinner while
the other climbers made their out-and-backs in the dark with their headlamps down to the
glacier collecing snow to melt for water.

We had pasta (torti) boiled up in Sam's jet-boil topped with a sauce of tuna, sliced
carrot, sliced red bell pepper, and pesto sauce along with some wine (the first bottle
would soon become the candle-stick holder for Babette's candle). As if we had not eaten
enough, we broke out the entire chicken (rotisserie) that we bought (and carried up
a mountain) and began to cut it up and devour. The other 8 or so people in the hut,
all preparing for treacherous ice-climbs further up the mountain in the early hours
of the morning, were surely jealous (or disgusted/confused?) at our carefree dinner, card game playing,
and merriment.

6/6 for going to huts and being the only group not climbing further up the mountain. Maybe
one of these days that will change, but it's pretty good times as it is I'd say.
