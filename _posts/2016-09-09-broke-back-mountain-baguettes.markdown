The bromantic story of where it all started...

It wasn't long after first learning to snowboard in the Alps that we began to do it frenchstyle:
packing two baguettes broken to backpack-size and a block of that good french cheese.
Sure we were snowboard noobs, but the back-crunching falls were mainly due to our crunchy baguettes.
Lunch time proved that even flat baguettes taste real good.

Our snowboard baguettes later included bits of chocolate. It is still
a debate between Danny and I whether plain milky 40% 'chocolate' or the
grand mouth-drying savoury makes-brats-cry 99% Lindt chocolate serves better.
For anything really.
