When your weekend adventure plans put Dan into an existential crisis, you know you're 
on to something. Turns out we were on to something <b>great</b> and we live to
sandwich another day. Crampons now included.


Ok, let's take a step back and see how we got to this state of Dan. Round abouts
Monday or Tuesday of the week leading up, I received the following information
from Claire, our resident cartographer ("Claire-tographer") and meteorology expert:

With this I came a step closer to understanding the early American forefathers
in their wish to go West (disregarding any genocidal notions) for with
this it was no longer our choice where or what
we were to do that weekend. For this, this was <em>Manifest Destiny</em> writ
on the largest of scales. The scales of the Alps.

Throughout the week it was rainy and grey in the Geneva area, though we weren't
deterred. We knew the weather was just "getting it out of its system". In addition,
Dan's birthday was this week and at dinner, when we were all their meeting a group
of Dan's lovely friends and getting to know Dan a bit better through their own eyes
and warmth towards him, it was a tacit assumption that he would be joining us
and we all silently pretended to not hear when the topic of him climbing
elsewhere that weekend came up. They say your mid-life crisis comes in the middle
of your thirties. This split-decision for the now thirty-four Dan happened
to be the seed of what was to become his.

The understanding was that we were to go to the Refuge Gervasutti. The "airplane
fuselage" stuck on the side of a moutain, serving as a bivouac for fellow alpine
adventurers. Come Friday evening, when plans were solidifying and it was
becoming clear that Dan would not be joining us, our nerves began to be tested.
The trek up to Gervasutti was rated as one of the more difficult hikes -- the
borderline between hiking and mountaineering becoming grey -- and Dan was clearly
worried that we might be getting in over our head. We would be starting relatively
late on this 5 hour trek and the unknown dangers of glaciers, snow, and climbing
that may have been coming disquited him. That evening, Dan got no work
done, secretly researching on camp-to-camp and elsewhere what the conditions,
difficulty, and exposure risks were for the trek up to Gervasutti (I say secretly
because in our office his computer screen faces me directly). His unease had its
effect and I too began researching alternatives. Dan even proposed that, after
his day of climbing, he would "meet up with us" at Gervasutti. His plan would be to
finish climbing, go through the Mont Blanc tunnel, put on his headlamp, and "start
walking". This was somewhat ridiculous and Claire did not agree with it, it being
more dangerous for himself to start a thousand meter trek in the late afternoon
with the sun soon going down behind the mountains. He should go climbing, do
what he had already agreed to before this. This, added with Sam's "can-do" attitude
and our need to stop by Vieux Campeur to pick up <em>everything</em> for Josh
on the way to Aosta, only aggravated Dan's unease. He paced back and forth.

Nevertheless, the fuselage prevailed and come nine o'clock in the morning on
Saturday we head out. I picked up Josh from Lafayette and we head to CERN to pick
up Claire who had to return the back-up RC phone to the ACR. I parked
at the kiss-and-fly zone of Entrance B, headed to the front entrance of 104 to
gather the whereabouts of Claire. She was spotted at the bike racks with a
sullen look and as I turned the corner lo and behold a Dan! Dan had apparently
woken up at the crack of dawn to go climbing and made it somehwere to buy credit
for his phone only to then use that credit to call his climbing partner to tell
him that he would not be climbing. What a goon! Was he sitting at CERN
for 2 hours waiting for us? We'll never know. I still wonder if he had slept
that evening -- the question of climbing versus a difficult mountain trek to a
unique bivouac weighing on him in the night.

So then we were off, Claire and Dan in Dan's Renault and Sam (picked up in Meyrin),
Josh, and I in my Yaris. On the way to Veiux Campeur the transition from Josh
not knowing what SYSK is to being a fan took place. He now knows how SPAM works.
At Vieux Campeur we picked up the needed
gear:
   1. 1 pair of crampons (for my boots)
   2. 2 pairs of ice-toothed Yak-trax for Sam and Josh
   3. 1 sleeping bag for Josh
   4. 2 Platypuses for Sam and Claire (no more wet sides for Claire)
   5. 1 climbing harness for Josh
   6. 1 macademia nut Clif bar for my stomach

All of which Sam paid for in order to take advantage of de-taxe, fulfilling
one of the benefits of having friends that live in Switzerland who adventure
in France :)

Before hitting the road again, we stopped at the Intermarche just down from
Vieux Campeur to pick the other provisions. Sam was on beverage duty, of course,
and Dan on dinner duty. Upon entering, Dan, with a box of pasta and a bottle of
olive oil in hand, had
dinner settled in less than five minutes. Sam was a bit longer looking for the
night's beverages. Once we had settled the cheese and bread situation we hit
the road, this time for the Mont Blanc tunnel and beyond.

Josh had never been to Italy before and on our exiting the tunnel and into Italy
we stopped at the rest-stop just on the other side that lets out onto the view
of Courmayeur and Aosta valley before turning left into Plancipeux and past
the starting point of a previous adventure, Rifugio Boccalatte, which we spotted
perched up there beneath the Grande Jorasses. This time we were to start further
down this valley, Gervasutti being beneath the <em>Petit</em> Jorasses.

We parked at the edge of the river, began apportioning the food between our
packs, "relieved" ourselves in the river, and began the hike. Gervasutti could
not yet be spotted from the valley floor. We walked for about fifteen minutes
before questioning our certainty of the trail, Sam and Dan already disregarding
clear marked paths (that were on our map) for trails off-piste but in a more
direct way towards the mountain. Within an hour we were out of the woods and
traversing the bouldery moraine on the left edge of the valley-inlet at the
vertex of which, some 700 meters above our heads at this point, lay the still
out-of-sight hut. We had clearly diverged from the trail that Claire's map had
for us, but there were plenty of cairnes around. Being themselves built up of
small rocks they were difficult to spot from afar, so we hopped from one to the
other in a fog-of-war of sorts in the warm Italian sun. We crossed to the right
side of the valley-inlet and soon we knew we were on the correct path to the hut.
