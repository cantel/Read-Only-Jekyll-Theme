When your weekend adventure plans put Dan into an existential crisis, you know you're 
on to something. Turns out we were on to something <b>great</b> and we live to
sandwich another day. Crampons now included.


Ok, let's take a step back and see how we got to this state of Dan. Round abouts
Monday or Tuesday of the week leading up, I received the following information
from Claire, our resident cartographer ("Claire-tographer") and meteorology expert:

With this I came a step closer to understanding the early American forefathers
in their wish to go West (disregarding any genocidal notions) for with
this it was no longer our choice where or what
we were to do that weekend. For this, this was <em>Manifest Destiny</em> writ
on the largest of scales. The scales of the Alps.

Throughout the week it was rainy and grey in the Geneva area, though we weren't
deterred. We knew the weather was just "getting it out of its system". In addition,
Dan's birthday was this week and at dinner, when we were all their meeting a group
of Dan's lovely friends and getting to know Dan a bit better through their own eyes
and warmth towards him, it was a tacit assumption that he would be joining us
and we all silently pretended to not hear when the topic of him climbing
elsewhere came up. They say your mid-life crisis comes in the middle of your
thirties. This split-decision for the now thirty-four Dan happened to be the
seed of what was to become his.
